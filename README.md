# Small Python Projects
Small Python projects with each project's detailed description included at the top of the Jupyter notebook. Brief summaries are below.
<br/> Exceptions.ipynb: An exception class hierarchy for a widget online sales application with a backend. The base `WidgetException` class will be used as the base class for all the custom exceptions raised from the Widget application.
<br/>SerializingPolygons.ipynb: A class for the PolygonsSequence sequence type that will return a series of (regular convex) Polygon objects.  Python's unittest is used to test the code.
<br/>Serializing Polygons with Iterator and Iterable.ipynb: Refactored code from SerializingPolygons.ipynb.  All the calculated properties in the Polygon class are lazy properties and PolygonsSequence is refactored into an iterable.  One can iterate over the PolygonsSequence with PolygonsIterator iterator.  Python's unittest is used to test the code.
